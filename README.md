# Team Rumbaugh's Robotics Group Project

This project was developed for Player/Stage platform. It includes
an implentation of Player Controller in Java that seeks to perform
tasks outlined:

1. Map the unkown environment and great a visual representation of it
2. Collect the garbage items in the map and deliver them to the 
designated area

The solution implemented works with one robot, uses wall following algorithm
to map the environment and bucket fill to detect the remaining unexplored
zones.
